# mage
iMAGE viewer


Another `ImLib2` image viewer. Based on `sxiv`. Meant to be a program that
sucks less.


# TODO
- Sort directory entries whether by giving `mage` a directory as an argument or
  by using `-r` (respecting LC)
- Top status bar
- Handle bar whether is on or off to not appear on top of images
  (configurenotify and window height operations)
- Order functions alphabetically
- Handle external commands **(if simple enough)**
- Thumbnail mode, requires to cache images to work 'smooth' **(if simple enough)**


# Questions
- prefix commands by default? looks 'simple' enough to add but I think this
  should be a patch.
- mouse support? handling icon cursos and positions
