iMAGE viewer


mage is a re-write of sxiv which goal is to be less complex in order for you to
hack on.


# TODO
- Get to the same state of sxiv, functionally
- top status bar
- man page
- better variable/function names (specially for zoom)
- simpler code. there is only one window in use, why is there a need to make a
  window to be an arg?
