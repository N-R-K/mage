# mage
iMAGE viewer


A re-write of sxiv which sucks less.


# TODO
- Thumbnail mode, requires to cache images to work 'smooth'
- Top status bar
- Order functions alphabetically
- Sort directory entries whether by giving `mage` a directory as an argument or by using `-r`
- Handle external commands


# Questions
- mouse support? handling icon cursos and positions
- prefix commands by default? looks 'simple' enough to add but I think this should be a patch.
