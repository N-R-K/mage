# mage
iMAGE viewer


Another `ImLib2` image viewer. Based on `sxiv`. Meant to be a program that
sucks less.


# TODO
- custom (thumbnail) mode that has different layouts (e.g. grid)
- Sort directory entries whether by giving `mage` a directory as an argument or
  by using `-r` (respecting LC)
- Top status bar
- Merge everything into mage.c and order functions alphabetically
