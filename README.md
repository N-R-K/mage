mage is a re-write of sxiv which goal is to be less complex in order for you to
hack on, which means patches! (which means features..)


# TODO
- Get to a similiar but simpler (and only functional) state of sxiv
- Top status bar
- Man page
- Better variable/function names (specially for zoom)
- Simpler code
